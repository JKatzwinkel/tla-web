<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>The publication platform <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> (<i>TLA</i>) hosted by the project <i>Strukturen und Transformationen des Wortschatzes der ägyptischen Sprache. Text- und Wissenskultur im Alten Ägypten</i> (2013‑2034) is a constantly-growing compendium of Egyptian texts from ca 3,000 BCE until 1,400 CE. External contributors have been assisting the setup of the <i>TLA</i> from its beginnings by enlarging the quantity and enhancing the quality of incorporated data.</p>
<p>The enormous amount of Egyptian texts (an estimated 5 million of word tokens for edited hieroglyphic and hieratic text alone) required and will further require extensive collaboration with other Egyptological projects, institutions, and single researchers. It is due to many Egyptologists’ belief in the necessity and feasibility of such a thing as the <i>TLA</i> that its story has become a successful one.</p>
<p>The <i>TLA</i> project's staff gladly welcomes collaborative work. Researchers in the field of Egyptology are encouraged and invited to publish their digital data of ancient Egyptian texts on the freely accessible platform <i>TLA</i> and so to participate in one the largest digital repositories in Egyptology. To facilitate submission, the project provides a free version of its input software (<a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/bts" target="_blank"><i>Berlin Text System</i></a>, <i>BTS</i>). Also other formats of raw textual data (transcriptions, <i>manuel de codage</i>, hieroglyphic text in <i>JSesh</i> or Unicode) can be processed for <i>TLA</i>. The <i>TLA</i> guarantees full credits and explicit acknowledgement of collaboration and collaborators. If you are interested in some kind of collaboration, please contact one of the Research Coordinators in Berlin (Dr. <a href="https://www.bbaw.de/die-akademie/mitarbeiterinnen-mitarbeiter/werning-daniel" target="_blank">Daniel Werning</a>) or Leipzig (Dr. <a href="https://www.saw-leipzig.de/de/mitarbeiter/dilsp" target="_blank">Peter Dils</a>).</p>
<p>The <i>TLA</i> owes a great debt of gratitude to institutions, projects, and independent researchers who have been supporting our project over the decades of its growth. Due to the European </i>General Data Protection Regulation</i>, we may not simply quote all individual contributers by name here without consent. However, you may find a selected <a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/projekt/kooperation" target="_bank">list of cooperations</a> on the project's BBAW homepage.</p>
