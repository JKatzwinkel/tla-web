<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> (<i>TLA</i>) is the non-commercial, free accessible digital publication platform of the project Structure and Transformation in the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language: Texts and Knowledge in the Culture of Ancient Egypt. It is funded by the Academies Program of The Union of the German Academies, and run by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.</p>
<p>The <i>TLA</i> provides a digital corpus of lemmatized and annotated Egyptian (hieroglyphic/hieratic, Demotic, Coptic) texts as well as electronic (hieroglyphic/hieratic, Demotic, Coptic) dictionaries of the ancient Egyptian language. </p>
<p>The <i>TLA</i> <a href="text-corpus">text corpus</a> and its <a href="dictionary">dictionary</a> alow to gather a wide range of information and to address historical, anthropological, and linguistic research questions relating to one of the earliest attested human civilizations and languages. Due to worldwide <a href="collaboration">collaboration</a>, the text corpus and its dictionary are permanently growing so as to offer someday a comprehensive library of extant Egyptian texts from antiquity.</p>
<p>The <i>TLA</i> text corpus and its dictionary can be browsed separately or in combination. Search results will be presented as text quotations on sentence level or full text level in Egyptological transliteration with full (German, English, or French) translation. A growing part of hieroglyphic and hieratic texts will be annotated with JSesh/Unicode hieroglyphs. Each dictionary item (lemma) and text item is annotated with information such as metadata, bibliographical references, and commenting notes. </p>

<h3>History of the <i>TLA</i></h3>
<p>The <i>TLA</i> is rooted in lexicographical work on the Ancient Egyptian language which was conducted under the direction of Adolf Erman at the Berlin Academy of Sciences and Humanities since 1897 and resulted in the printed dictionary (Erman and Grapow, <i>Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache</i>, five vols., 1926‒1931, seven further supplement volumes until 1961). In 1992, with the inauguration of the project "<i>Altägyptisches Wörterbuch</i>" (1992‒2012) at the same academy, the digital agenda of an electronic corpus of Egyptian full text was implemented. In 1996, the Berlin team was augmented by a project team run by the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Leipzig.</p>
<p>A first step to digital publication was taken in 1999 when the digitized lexicographical slips generated and accumulated in the decades of work on the <i>Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache</i> were released as „<a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/dza" target="_blank"><i>Digitales Zettelarchiv</i></a>“ (<i>DZA</i>). The <i>DZA</i> offers access to the whole wealth of textual resources used for the preparation the <i>Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache</i> whose printed outcome—the dictionary and its supplementing <i>Belegstellen</i> volumes—presented and referenced only about 10% of the collected material. </p>
<p>The first, original <i>TLA</i> was coded by Stefan Johannes Seidlmayer and started in the World Wide Web on 31 October 2004, Erman’s 150<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>By 2020, the <i>TLA</i> has been increasing to about 1.4 million token instances of Egyptian words and has become a reliable and powerful research instrument. Its several search functionalities, such as search for Egyptian words (lemmata), full texts search, search for word collocations and combinations, and search for hieroglyphic spellings, help Egyptologists, scholars from neighboring disciplines, and other interested parties to pursue their research interests.</p>

<h3>Future Perspectives of the <i>TLA</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>An <em>integrated word list</em> of the entire Egyptian-Coptic vocabulary:</br>
The two already implemented reference lists for lemmatization, the hieroglyphic/hieratic and Demotic lemma lists, are being expanded by a third component, the Coptic lemma list (including the large share of loan vocabulary that had become part of the Egyptian lexicon in the 1<sup>st</sup> millennium CE, notably Greek words). The new key feature will be created by <em>integrating</em> these three diachronic lexica into one structure. The systematic conjunction of Egyptian-Coptic lexical cognates from their earliest appearance up to their last attestation in the written language will the first time give a full account of single changes and overall transformations in the Egyptian lexicon through its 4,000 years lifespan, and the first time allow systematic monitoring of the dynamics of spreading innovations, retainment, and obsolescence in the Egyptian-Coptic lexicon at token level.</li>
<li>An Ontology of the ancient Egyptian vocabulary:</br>
This feature will open perspectives on semantic relations in the Egyptian lexicon, their synchronic structures, and their diachronic changes.</li>
