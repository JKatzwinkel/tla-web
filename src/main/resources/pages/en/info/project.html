<h2>TLA / Project</h2>
<p>The institutional background of the online publication platform <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> (<i>TLA</i>) is the long-term project <i>Strukturen und Transformationen des Wortschatzes der ägyptischen Sprache. Text- und Wissenskultur im Alten Ägypten</i> (2013‑2034). It is funded by the Academies’ Program of the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities. In two offices, located at Berlin (Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities) and Leipzig (Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Leipzig), two research teams of Egyptologists and a software developer take care for the maintenance, the technical and conceptual development, and growth of the <i>TLA</i> and its text encoding system (<a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/bts" target="_blank"><i>Berlin Text System</i></a>, <i>BTS</i>). Volunteering researchers from all around in Egyptology have been supporting the daily labors of the project staff by contributing data of their own text editions to the <i>TLA</i> corpus.</p>
<p>The project aims to document and annotate the Ancient Egyptian language through its entire lifespan of more than 4,000 years from ca 3,000 BCE until ca 1,400 CE. Its research outcome – a digital <a href="dictionary">dictionary</a> and a <a href="text-corpus">text corpus</a> – are published exclusively in electronic form via the project’s publication platform <i>TLA</i>. </p>
<p>The <a href="text-corpus">text corpus</a> is to compile ancient Egyptian texts of any type from all periods of the written language in the hieroglyphic/hieratic, Demotic and Coptic script on any possible type of writing support. Each single text word is linked to the digital <a href="dictionary">dictionary</a> which is divided into three word lists, of the hieroglyphic/hieratic lemma list, the Demotic lemma list, and the <i>Comprehensive Coptic Lexicon</i>. At present these three lemma lists serve to lemmatize Egyptian texts written in different scripts at different times. In a future step the three will be incorporated into one integrated dictionary of the entirety of Egyptian language so as to provide, for the first time, the opportunity to study texts and words across the boundaries of individual scripts (hieroglyphic, hieratic, Demotic, Coptic) and language phases (Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian, Late Egyptian, Demotic, Coptic).</p>
<p>The project invites researchers from the fields of Egyptology and Demotic studies to submit their text editions to the <i>TLA</i>. <a href="collaboration">Collaboration</a> can help to increase the quantitative data basis and thereby raise its benefits for any kind of study on the Ancient Egyptian language and culture.</p>
